## 📌 Project Summary

This project applies **Time Series Forecasting** to predict quarterly Netflix subscription growth using historical data. Using ARIMA and Python’s data stack, I modeled the future subscription trend to help simulate how platforms like Netflix plan for **subscriber growth, content strategy, and financial forecasting**. The project demonstrates how data-driven insights can enhance decision-making in the streaming industry.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Forecasting subscriber growth is crucial for OTT platforms like Netflix to:
- Plan production and marketing budgets
- Anticipate server load and infrastructure scaling
- Strategize content development and release
- Ensure business continuity through accurate forecasting

This project was independently conceptualized and built to sharpen my skills in **time series modeling, data visualization, and Python-based analytics**.

## 🚀 Quantified Project Achievements

- 📊 Analyzed 10 years of quarterly Netflix data (2013–2023)  
- 🧠 Built an ARIMA(1,1,1) model with statistically validated parameters (p, d, q)  
- ⏱️ Achieved sub-second forecasting for next **5 quarters** with accurate results  
- 🔍 Identified **non-seasonal trends** in subscriber growth using ACF/PACF and differencing  
- 📈 Calculated and visualized **quarterly & yearly growth rates** with color-coded bars  
- 🧮 Converted static growth data into a time-series format and made **5 future predictions**  
- 📊 Used **Plotly** for interactive, publication-quality visualizations  

---

## 👨‍💻 What I Did

- Cleaned and transformed subscription data into time series format  
- Visualized subscriber growth using **Plotly** and **Matplotlib**  
- Conducted time series diagnostics: stationarity, ACF, PACF, differencing  
- Built and evaluated ARIMA model with optimized hyperparameters  
- Predicted future subscription counts and visualized with overlaid graphs
